Goal here is to discuss colormaps. Although tons of focus on *not* using the rainbow colormap, this should be a small section of it. Discuss when to use sequential vs. diverging with examples of good cases (can provide data for them to play around with it). Maybe show some respectfully bad examples of color (Rintoul 2018 on Southern Ocean comes to mind for bad diverging map).

No red to green! Always consider color blindness. Suggest tools for that.

In general colors should encode another bit of information for plots, but I generally don't think that's super important. Discuss the power of using gray.
