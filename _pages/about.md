I analyze output from state-of-the-art Earth System Models (ESMs) to understand the impacts of internal climate variability and anthropogenic climate change on regional ocean biogeochemistry. In particular, I focus on carbonate chemistry in Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems and more recently the Southern Ocean. 

My toolkit generally includes multi-model and single-model ensembles. I have used these to assess signal-to-noise ratios in long-term projections of upwelling [(Brady et al., 2017)](/papers/Brady2017.pdf), to isolate the influence of internal climate variability on air-sea  CO$$_{2}$$ fluxes [(Brady et al., 2019a)](/papers/Brady2019a.pdf), and to make multiyear forecasts of pH [(Brady et al., 2019b)](/papers/Brady2019b.pdf). On occasion, I assess satellite and in situ products, but am most eager to use supercomputers in my work. 

I contribute to a number of open-source python packages for the geosciences and am a core developer for [climpred](climpred.readthedocs.io) and [esmtools](esmtools.readthedocs.io). I am passionate about data visualization and have recently been working with ParaView to make [movies](https://vimeo.com/user96067365) of high-resolution climate models.

I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences](http://www.colorado.edu/atoc/) at the University of Colorado Boulder. I collaborate with the [NOAA Earth System Research Lab](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/), [National Center for Atmospheric Research](http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/), [Los Alamos National Lab](https://www.lanl.gov/org/ddste/aldsc/theoretical/index.php), and [Oak Ridge National Lab](https://www.ornl.gov/group/ces). My research is supported by the Department of Energy through a [Computational Science Graduate Fellowship](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/fellows/profile?n=brady2016).
