I am a Senior Data Scientist at the newly developing Climate Analytics team at McKinsey & Company. Our group spun off of McKinsey's [ACRE](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/agriculture/how-we-help-clients/acre) practice and focuses primarily on physical and transition risk of climate change. 

During my PhD, I analyzed output from state-of-the-art Earth System Models (ESMs) to understand the impacts of internal climate variability and anthropogenic climate change on regional ocean biogeochemistry. In particular, I focused on carbonate chemistry in Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems and more recently the Southern Ocean. 

My toolkit generally includes multi-model and single-model ensembles. I have used these to assess signal-to-noise ratios in long-term projections of upwelling [(Brady et al., 2017)](/papers/Brady2017.pdf), to isolate the influence of internal climate variability on air-sea  CO$$_{2}$$ fluxes [(Brady et al., 2019)](/papers/Brady2019.pdf), and to make multiyear forecasts of pH [(Brady et al., 2020)](/papers/Brady2020.pdf). On occasion, I assess satellite and *in situ* products, but am most eager to use supercomputers in my work. 

I [contribute](/software) to a number of open-source python packages for the geosciences and am a core developer for [climpred](https://climpred.readthedocs.io) and [esmtools](https://esmtools.readthedocs.io). I am passionate about data visualization and have recently been working with ParaView to make [movies](https://vimeo.com/user96067365) of high-resolution climate models.
