I analyze output from state-of-the-art Earth System Models (ESMs) to understand the impacts of internal climate variability and anthropogenic climate change on regional ocean biogeochemistry. In particular, I focus on carbon dynamics and carbonate chemistry in Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems. My toolkit generally includes multi-model and single-model climate ensembles, which I use in quantifying uncertainty in long-term projections. On occasion, I assess satellite and in situ products, but am most eager to use supercomputers in my work. My end goal for any project is to use proper data visualization, typography, and communication to make my science accessible to anyone.

I am a Ph.D. student in [Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences](http://www.colorado.edu/atoc/) at the University of Colorado Boulder. I work with the [Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research](https://instaar.colorado.edu/people/riley-brady/) and the [Theoretical Division at Los Alamos National Lab](https://www.lanl.gov/org/ddste/aldsc/theoretical/index.php) and am supported by the Department of Energy through a [Computational Science Graduate Fellowship](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/fellows/profile?n=brady2016).
