  abstract = {The California Current System (CCS) sustains economically valuable fisheries and is particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification, due to the natural upwelling of corrosive waters that affect ecosystem function. Marine resource managers in the CCS could benefit from advanced knowledge of ocean acidity on multiyear timescales. We use a novel suite of retrospective forecasts with an initialized Earth system model (ESM) to predict the evolution of surface pH anomalies in the CCS. Here we show that the forecast system skillfully predicts observed surface pH variations multiple years in advance over a naïve forecasting method. Skillful predictions of surface pH are mainly derived from the initialization of dissolved inorganic carbon anomalies that are subsequently transported into the CCS. Our results demonstrate the potential for ESMs to provide predictions relevant to managing the onset and impacts of ocean acidification in this vulnerable region.},

  abstract = {Understanding the origins of nutrients, e.g., nitrate, in ocean water is essential to develop an effective mariculture technique forfree-floating macroalgae, which presents a potential solution to provide an alternative source of domestic renewable fuels to helpreduce carbon emissions from automobiles. To study this problem, scientists simulate large-scale computational simulationswith coupled flow and nutrient information. Since running the simulation multiple times is expensive, the scientists want tohave efficient visual-analytic techniques that can analyze and visualize the simulation output quickly to investigate the reasonsbehind the existence of nitrate in different areas of ocean water. To address these needs, a mixed Lagrangian and Eulerian-based analysis technique is developed that leverages traditional Lagrangian analysis methods and fuses Eulerian informationwith it to comprehend the origins of nutrients in the water. The proposed method yielded promising results for the applicationscientists and positive feedback from them demonstrates the efficacy of the technique.},

  title={On the role of climate modes in modulating the air--sea CO2 fluxes in {Eastern} {Boundary} {Upwelling} {Systems}},
  author={Brady, Riley X and Lovenduski, Nicole S and Alexander, Michael A and Jacox, Michael and Gruber, Nicolas},
  journal={Biogeosciences},
  abstract = {The air–sea CO2 fluxes in eastern boundary upwelling systems (EBUSs) vary strongly in time and space, with some of the highest flux densities globally. The processes controlling this variability have not yet been investigated consistently across all four major EBUSs, i.e., the California (CalCS), Humboldt (HumCS), Canary (CanCS), and Benguela (BenCS) Current systems. In this study, we diagnose the climatic modes of the air–sea CO2 flux variability in these regions between 1920 and 2015, using simulation results from the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LENS), a global coupled climate model ensemble that is forced by historical and RCP8.5 radiative forcing. Differences between simulations can be attributed entirely to internal (unforced) climate variability, whose contribution can be diagnosed by subtracting the ensemble mean from each simulation. We find that in the CalCS and CanCS, the resulting anomalous CO2 fluxes are strongly affected by large-scale extratropical modes of variability, i.e., the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), respectively. The CalCS has anomalous uptake of CO2 during the positive phase of the NPGO, while the CanCS has anomalous outgassing of CO2 during the positive phase of the NAO. In contrast, the HumCS is mainly affected by El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), with anomalous uptake of CO2 during an El Niño event. Variations in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and sea surface temperature (SST) are the major contributors to these anomalous CO2 fluxes and are generally driven by changes to large-scale gyre circulation, upwelling, the mixed layer depth, and biological processes. A better understanding of the sensitivity of EBUS CO2 fluxes to modes of climate variability is key in improving our ability to predict the future evolution of the atmospheric CO2 source and sink characteristics of the four EBUSs.},

  title={Emergent anthropogenic trends in California Current upwelling},
  author={Brady, Riley X and Alexander, Michael A and Lovenduski, Nicole S and Rykaczewski, Ryan R},
  journal={Geophysical Research Letters},
  abstract = {Upwelling in the California Current System (CCS) sustains a productive ecosystem and is mediated by alongshore, equatorward wind stress. A decades‐old hypothesis proposes that global warming will accelerate these upwelling favorable winds. Recent analyses provide empirical support for upwelling intensification in the poleward portion of the CCS. However, these studies rely on proxies for upwelling and are limited in their ability to distinguish anthropogenic forcing from internal climate variability. Here we estimate simulated changes in CCS upwelling from 1920 to 2100 using monthly output from a single climate model ensemble, where divergences among simulations can be attributed entirely to internal climate variability. Our projections suggest that CCS upwelling will become more intense in the spring and less intense in the summer as a result of anthropogenic climate change. Anthropogenic changes in upwelling will emerge primarily in the second half of the century.},
